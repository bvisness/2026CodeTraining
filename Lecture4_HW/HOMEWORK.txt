Greetings, students! Your homework is to create a complete field-relative
swerve drive program. You must do the following:

- Create robot.py and set up the main robot class. It MUST have the following
  variables defined:
   - self.drivetrain, set to an instance of the Drivetrain subsystem.
- Create subsystems/drivetrain.py and set up the Drivetrain subsystem. It MUST
  have the following variables defined:
   - self.frontLeftSwerveModule, set to an instance of SwerveModule
   - self.frontRightSwerveModule, ditto
   - self.backLeftSwerveModule, ditto
   - self.backRightSwerveModule, ditto
   - self.gyro, set to an instance of navx.AHRS

!! CHECKPOINT 1 !!: You should be able to launch the simulator and see no
errors in the terminal.

- Implement teleoperated controls for the robot. Pushing up, down, left, and
  right on the left stick should move the robot forward, backward, left, and
  right relative to the driver. Pushing right and left on the right stick
  should turn the robot clockwise and counterclockwise. (Remember what we
  learned in lecture 3.) Use these desired controls to create ChassisSpeeds
  and publish them to NetworkTables.
- Make the robot move faster than the default. It should have the following top
  speeds:
   - 4 meters per second when moving up, down, left, or right
   - 2 radians per second when rotating

!! CHECKPOINT 2 !!: You should be able to view your desired ChassisSpeeds in
the Swerve tab of AdvantageScope, and the controls should match what was
described above.

- Use kinematics to compute desired states for all four swerve modules. Pass
  them along to the setDesiredState method of the four SwerveModule objects you
  created.
- Call getActualState on the SwerveModule objects to get the actual speed and
  direction of each module. Publish them to AdvantageScope so you can see them.
- Choose PID constants in configs.py so that the swerve modules steer toward
  the desired state.

!! CHECKPOINT 3 !!: You should be able to see your wheels steering correctly in
the simulation. In fact, you should have a complete and functional swerve drive
robot!

Copy-pasting from previous assignments and example code is allowed and STRONGLY
ENCOURAGED!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are given a few files to start:

- constants.py: A file containing constant values describing physical
  properties of the robot, e.g. what size the wheels are and where they are
  positioned.
- configs.py (INCOMPLETE): A file containing configuration objects for the
  drive and steering motors.
- hardware/swervemodule.py: A class which contains common logic for all four
  swerve modules.
- ntutil.py: A file which contains utilities for posting data to NetworkTables
  for viewing in AdvantageScope.
- utils.py: A file which contains several helpful functions that may be of use
  to you.

Additionally, the following files MUST NOT be touched, or you will probably
break the physics simulation that you need in order to test your code:

- physics.py: A file which implements physics simulation for the swerve drive.
- sim/rotatingobject.py: A class which implements some of the physics
  simulation for the sim.

!! EXTRA CREDIT !!

If you can't get enough, try implementing some extra functionality:

- Make field-relative controls work for both the red and blue alliance. You can
  change your alliance in the simulator by clicking Disconnected, then changing
  the alliance station in the FMS panel, then clicking Disabled or
  Teleoperated to "reconnect".
- Make the robot drive in autonomous! Make the robot drive a simple route of
  your choosing.
